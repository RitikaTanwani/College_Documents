You need to submit a TEX source which when compiled using pdf L TEX (the
	command pdflatex), produces an exact copy of this pdf, except the sections
on passwordless ssh and the marking scheme.
The only difference being that it should have your Name, Roll No. and Email
in the author field, in place of ours, and the date of compilation (today) in the
date field, if it differs from what’s present in this file. Try to match the type-
setting as closely as you can.
Each of the following carries marks:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Content
    \item Text formatting
      \item Document structure
      \end{enumerate}
     This document has been typeset using the article documentclass, with paper
     dimensions a4 and font size 10pt.
     The following packages have been used:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item{\textsf{url} to display URLs}
     \item{\textsf{ hyperref} to make links (including URLs) clickable}
	     
     \item{\textsf {graphicx}to include image}
     \item{\textsf {listings} to include source code}
     
     \item{\textsf {xcolor} to get a variety of font colours, referrable by name (used in the
		     source code listings)
     }
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note}: If you look closely, you’ll see that this abstract has been generated
using a special command, which is part of the article documentclass (it has a
		lesser font size and a smaller margin)! Find it.\\
\textbf{Note}: We have not used BibTEX for the References. They are written in
the tex file itself.

   {\scriptsize size} 
    {\footnotesize size}
     {\small size}
      {\normalsize size}
{\LARGE  varied}




       \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Bold text}
     \item \emph{emphasised text} 
     \item \textsl{Slanted Text}
     \item \textsc{Text in small caps}
    \item \textsf{sans serif}
         \item   \textrm{roman}
   \end{itemize}
   The above is done using this:
 \begin{verbatim}

 \textit{For example, this text is written in italics, but
	 \emph{these words are emphasized text}}. Also, this
	 is normal text, but \emph{this is emphasized text}.
\end{verbatim}	 
   \section{Typesetting Mathematics}
Math can be typeset inline, for example: a = b2 + c, or displayed separately as
shown in the rest of this section.\\
\textit{Note: Do not get intimidated, there are simple commands for generating most
	of the symbols/structures shown below!

   \subsection{ General Formulae}
\[
D= \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\]
\subsection{Calculas}
\[
 \int_0^\infty x^{n}e^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x =n!
 \]
\subsection{Counting}
\[
^nC_r={n\choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}
\]
\subsection{Trigonometry}
\[
\sin^2 + \cos^2=1
\]
