					<h1>Erdos Number</h1>
					
					<h1> Question </h1>

					A popular pastime of Computer Scientists is to compute their Erdos number. <br>
					Paul Erdos is a Hungarian mathematician known for this excellent contributions to several disciplines of mathematics including probability, combinatorics, graphs, and the like.<br> 
					
					To recognize his efforts, an Erdos number is defined as follows : <br>
					<ul>
					   <li> 
					      The Erdos number of Erdos himself is 0.
					   </li>
					   <li>
					      If person X co-authors a paper along with Erdos, then the Erdos number of X is 1. 
					   </li>
					   <li>
					      The Erdos number of a person Y is one more than the smallest Erdos number of any of his current co-authors.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					   
					   <b> Note : We say that A and B are co-authors if A and B authored a paper together at some point of time, possibly along with other co-authors. </b> <br>
					For deciding the Erdos number of any author, you have to apply the above three rules in the same order as above.
					i.e. First check if author X is Erdos, if not then you have to check if X co-authored a paper with Erdos and so on<br>

					It is beleived that an Erdos number greater than four is nothing to be proud of, where as an Erdos
					number of two is a big acheivement. <br>

					We will consider that vertex numbered 1 is the vertex corresponding to Erdos. The output will be a listing of the
					Erdos number of the vertices in the following format: a1 , a2 , . . . , aN .

					
					<h1>Input Specification</h1>

					The input will be as follows : <br>
					1. The first line will contain the number of authors (N). Authors will be denoted by integers from 1 to N, 1 being Erdos himself<br>
					2. The next line will contain the number of lines in the input (M) <br>
					3. This will be followed by M separate lines, each of which will contain an input of the form : <br>
					<font text-align="center"><b> a b c d -1</b> </font> <br>
					Here, it means a,b,c and d are co-authors of some paper, -1 to indicate termination of line.
					We will assume that a, b, c and d are positive integers.
					We will consider that vertex numbered 1 is the vertex corresponding to Erdos.

					<h1>Output Specification</h1>
					The output will consist of (space separated) listing of Erdos Number Values starting from author 1 till author N.
					In the above, we arrange the authors in increasing order of indices and print their corresponding Erdos numbers. <br>
					So, the Erdos number of author 1 is printed first, followed by the Erdos number of author 2, and so on. <br>

					<h1>Sample Input</h1>
					9<br>
					7<br>
					1 3 4 -1<br>
					1 4 2 -1<br>
					3 4 7 -1<br>
					3 5 -1<br>
					3 6 -1<br>
					4 8 -1<br>
					2 9 -1<br>
					<h1>Sample Output</h1>
					0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2<br>
