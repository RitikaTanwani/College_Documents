					<h1>H Index of Researcher</h1>
					
					<h1> Question </h1>
					One measure that is gaining popularity recently for researcher effectiveness is the h-index. <br>
					Read about it on wikepedia. <br>
					
					In this problem, we compute a slightly new mesaure as follows :  <br>
					
					Conisder a graph with two kinds of nodes: author nodes 
corresponding to authors, and paper nodes that correspond to papers. <br>
					There are directed edges from an author node A to all the papers that are authored/co-authored by A. <br>
					
					There are also directed edges between papers such that an edge from P1 to P2 indicates that paper P2 cites paper P1.<br>
					Given this graph, for each author find his h-index defined as follows : <br>
					
					An author is said to have a h- index of k if exactly k of his 
papers have at least k citations and the remaining papers have at most k
 citations each. <br>
					
					<!--	In counting the citations of a paper Pi you should discount citations Pk such that there exists a paper Pj where Pj cites Pi , and Pk cites both Pj and Pi . <br /> 					
					In case there is such a Pk with 2 or more such Pj's, discount Pk only once overall. <br /> -->

					
					Under the above definition, find the h-index of all authors in the input.<br>
					


					<h1>Input Specification</h1>
					First Line : Number of Authors (A)<br>
					Second Line : Number of Papers (P)<br>
					Third Line : Number of Author-Paper Tuples (M)<br>
					Fourth Line : Number of Paper-Paper Tuples (N)<br>
					This is followed by M lines of Author-Paper tuples and then N lines of Paper-Paper tuples.<br>
					Author 1 will be denoted as a1, Author 2 as a2 and so on <br>
					Paper 1 will be denoted as p1, Paper 2 will be denoted as p2 and so on <br>
					<h1>Output Specification</h1>
					Output the h-index of each author on separate line, starting from author 1, then author 2 and so on till the last author.<br>

					<h1>Sample Input</h1>
					3<br>
					3<br>
					4<br>
					2<br>
					a1 p1<br>
					a2 p2<br>
					a3 p3<br>
					a2 p3<br>
					p2 p3<br>
					p3 p1<br>

					<h1>Sample Output</h1>
